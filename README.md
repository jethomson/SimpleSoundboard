create_soundboard.py will take a folder of mp3 and/or wav files convert them to base64 data URLs and output a webpage of buttons that will play the audio files.

This script was written in order to have a simple way to play audio files from a smartphone for a Halloween costume.

Once the html file has been created, just copy it to your smartphone and open it in your web browser.

There is no need to copy over the audio files, have an internet connection, run a local web server, or make configuration changes to your web browser so it can read local files referenced by an html file.
